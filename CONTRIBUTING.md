## How to help

To help with the project, start by copying the contents of the [post template](https://github.com/WillSullivan/idownvotedbecause/blob/master/posttemplate.txt) into a new markdown file.

The name of the markdown file should be a very short topic description, and placed in a subfolder based on the community.

## Using the template

The template should be clear (or clear once you submit a pull request to improve it!) on the front matter components, what they are for, and how they should be configured.

It should also be clear on the sections that should be included, their order, and what they should contain.

## Tone

Be conscious of the tone of your topic. Talk about the problem as if it was its own entity, not the result of what any specific person did. If you aren't sure what this means, check the history of this document for an example. 

Be careful of sounding accusatory towards an individual person, rather speak of any person in a similar situation. And try not to use the passive voice _too_ much. State facts as they exist.

## images

Images should be stored under /images in a subfolder by community (the same as the one you are posting about). Try to keep images as small as possible, focusing on what is important. We don't want to see your browser tabs. Also, images without freehand circles will be rejected. More freehand circles, pls.

## Markdown
The site uses Kramdown for markdown processing. It's got some special features over and above standard markdown. [Here's a quick reference guide to its syntax.](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#html-elements-1)
