# This website is designed to help people understand why you downvoted.

Participation in a reputation-ranked online community comes with its ups and downs. You post something and it gets upvoted when people like or agree with it--*and that's great!* You feel good about yourself and what you've done. You've won.

*Unfortunately,* it may also recieve a downvote because **someone didn't.**

Maybe your post got downvoted, and you're wondering why. Or maybe you're the downvoter, and you want to let the person who owns the post why you downvoted, with the ultimage goal that they can fix any problems it has. This website is **built for you.**

The goal for *I Downvoted Because* is to give people an **easy, productive and helpful way** to let someone know **what caused your downvote, what they can do to fix it, and why you think they should do so.** It gives people experience downvotes a simple way to learn why. They can learn what the culture of a community sees as the reason for the downvote, as well as how to reverse it. Each reason comes with detailed steps on what a user can do to turn a downvote into an upvote.

## How does this website work? 
This website hosts one page per reason for a downvote. Each reason has its own URL in the format
